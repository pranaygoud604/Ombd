              <h1>Stream better, support the industry, feel <br>awesome.</h1><p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Streaming movies and tv shows illegally sucks.</p>
              <p>It sucks for you because you'll get a lower quality version of whatever it is you're trying to watch.</p><p>But perhaps most importantly, it sucks for the people who worked on the film or tv show.</p><p>A huge amount of cast and crew members worked tirelessly to produce your favorite content, even if you don't realize it. And yes, the stars of Hollywood might get paid huge amounts for their work, but the majority of the crew will be on modest wages, and will only continue to get work if the films and tv shows they're working on make money.</p><p>That's the crucial bit - <strong><em>make money.&nbsp;</em></strong>If a company like Amazon, Netflix or Hulu buys the rights to stream a film or tv show, then they make money. And the more people who sign up to services like Amazon or Hulu to watch the film or tv show, or who buy or rent the movie through these platforms - the more these large companies continue to buy the rights of movies and tv shows. Which is great for the industry.</p><p>So, that's what we focus on. We show you where to watch movies online legally at the best price possible. We'll even show you free trials you can use on certain platforms to watch great movies or documentaries for free. <strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>We often use affiliate links if we're recommending a product or service, which results in us receiving a small commission if you decide to purchase a product or use a service that we recommend (at no extra cost to you). You don't have to use our links if you don't want to, and actually companies like Amazon often have arrangements with charities where you can use charity affiliate links to purchase items on there, giving a bit of money to the charity. Go do that instead!</p><p><br></p><p>StreamingMoviesRight.com is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com</p></div></div></quill-view-html></div></div><!----><!---->
